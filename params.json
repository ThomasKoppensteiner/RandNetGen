[1,2]. We use two different rewiring schemes. In the first one (-pkk 0), two different edges are chosen at random. Let these connect nodes A with B and C with D. Then, the two edges are swapped so that nodes A and D, on the one hand, and C and B, on the other, are now connected. We take care that no self-connections or multiple connections between the same pair of nodes are induced by this process. This rewiring scheme preserves the degree distribution of the original network but not degree-degree correlations. In the second rewiring scheme (-pkk 1), we first chose an edge at random and look at the degree of one of its attached nodes, k. Then, a second link attached to a node of the same degree k is chosen and the two links are swapped as before. Notice that this procedure preserves both the degree of each node and the actual nodes’ degrees at the end of the two original edges. Therefore, the procedure preserves the full degree-degree correlation structure encoded in the joint distribution *P(k k')*. Both procedures are ergodic and satisfy detailed balance.\r\n\r\nIn case the program is configured to fix any kind of clustering (spectrum,coefficient or number of triangles) or average neighbours degree (*Knn(k)*) it generates maximally random clustered networks by means of a biased rewiring procedure. Regardless of the rewiring scheme, explained above, at use, the process is biased so that generated graphs belong to an exponential ensemble of graphs. Here we consider ensembles where the Hamiltonian depends on the target property.\r\n\r\nIn case you are interested in randomizing weighted networks take a look at [multi edge randomizer](https://github.com/osagarra/Multi_edge_randomizer) by Oleguer Sagarra.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nI want to thank Sergio Oller, Chiara Orsini, Oriol Vilanova and Marian Boguñá for their very useful comments and suggestions.\r\n\r\n## References \r\n\r\n[1] Pol Colomer-de-Simón, M Angeles Serrano, Mariano Beiró, \r\n    J.
